Starting the cypress automation training

command to run to open cypress test runner : npx cypress open

through command line, cypress run in headless in electron(default)(means browser won't open)

to run tests(headless mode) - 
npx cypress run 

to run test(headed mode) - 
npx cypress run --headed

to run test in other browser than electron - 
npx cypress --browser chrome/firefox/edge

for auto recomendation add the following line to test
/// <reference types="cypress"/>

cypress is async in nature

should belongs to chai 

console.log prints data in browser console
cy.log prints data in test logs


cypress auto accepts the alert. it just clicks ok on its own

assertions are done by mocha
mocha framework
cypress api
invoke is a jQuery fxn

cypress cannot handle child tabs, so we need to manipulate the DOM, such that it opens in same tabs by removing target attribute

for mouse hover cypress doesn't have any default methods, we use jQuery methods - invoke('show') or we can force click an element

another way of handling child windows is by grabbing href link as we have access to DOM and going to it

we use jQuery method to get attribue value - prop method

to handle frames need to add plugin npm install -D cypress-iframe   - know the frame id
